## Executive Summary

Using various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes, I will use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. Using my knowledge of the imbalanced-learn library, youâ€™ll use a logistic regression model to compare two versions of the dataset.

## Technologies / Installation Guide

This application is written in Python 3.7 using JupyterLab version 3.0.14.

Import the following libraries:

- pandas (an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.)
- Pathlib (a library that enables consistent input and output of files from the main app.)
- scikit-learn (an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning.)
- numpy (a Python library that adds support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.)

## Usage

The `credit_risk_resampling.ipynb` notebook will be used to complete the following tasks:

- Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
- Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data
- Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

-----

## Results

- The first logistic regression model predicts the healthy loans with 100% accuracy, and the high risk loans with 85% accuracy.
- The second logistic regression model predicts the healthy loans with 100% accuracy, and the high risk loans with 84% accuracy.
